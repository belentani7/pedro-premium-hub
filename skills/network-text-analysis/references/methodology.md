# Methodology Reference

## Formal Betweenness Centrality

For node v:

```
BC(v) = Σ(σ_st(v) / σ_st)
```

Where:
- σ_st = total shortest paths from s to t
- σ_st(v) = shortest paths from s to t passing through v

**Interpretation**: High BC nodes are bridges between clusters. They control information flow.

**Quick approximation without formal calculation**:
1. For each node, count how many distinct clusters its neighbors belong to.
2. Nodes touching 3+ clusters = high betweenness candidates.

## Community Detection (Modularity)

Modularity Q measures how well a partition into communities captures excess internal density:

```
Q = (1/2m) Σ_ij [A_ij - (k_i * k_j / 2m)] δ(c_i, c_j)
```

Where:
- A_ij = edge weight between i and j
- k_i = degree of node i
- m = total edge weight
- δ(c_i, c_j) = 1 if i,j in same community

**Practical heuristic**: Louvain algorithm (greedy modularity optimization). Available in NetworkX, igraph, graphology.

## Structural Gap Detection

```
1. Run community detection → get clusters C1, C2, ..., Cn
2. For each cluster pair (Ci, Cj):
   a. Count inter-cluster edges E(Ci, Cj)
   b. If E(Ci, Cj) < threshold (e.g., 10% of intra-cluster edges):
      → GAP detected between Ci and Cj
3. For each gap, find candidate bridging nodes:
   a. Nodes in Ci that have neighbors in Cj's neighborhood
   b. Or nodes with high BC that sit between Ci and Cj
4. Generate bridging questions:
   "How does [concept from Ci] relate to [concept from Cj]?"
```

## Cognitive State Transitions

```
BIASED → FOCUSED: Develop the dominant cluster, add adjacent concepts
FOCUSED → DIVERSIFIED: Introduce smaller clusters, bridge gaps
DIVERSIFIED → DISPERSED: Break connections, bring in outside concepts
DISPERSED → BIASED: Anchor to highest-BC node, rebuild focus

Shortcut paths (figure-8 pattern):
BIASED ↔ FOCUSED (building loop)
DIVERSIFIED ↔ DISPERSED (exploring loop)
Cross-point: shift between building and exploring
```

## Dwelling Thresholds

| State | Safe Duration | Risk After |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Biased | 2-3 exchanges | Obsessive rigidity |
| Focused | 3-5 exchanges | Saturation fatigue |
| Diversified | 4-7 exchanges | Analysis paralysis |
| Dispersed | 2-4 exchanges | Confusion/anxiety |
